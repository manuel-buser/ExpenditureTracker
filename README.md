# ExpenditureTracker

ExpenditureTracker is planned to be an intelligent expenditure tracking application that revolutionizes personal finance management by automating expense detection and categorization. The vision for this project includes:

## Future Vision

- **Automated Expense Detection:**  
  Users will be able to upload bank statements, receipts, PDFs, and other financial documents. The application will employ OCR and AI-based text analysis to automatically extract and process expense data, eliminating manual data entry.

- **Smart Categorization:**  
  Advanced algorithms and natural language processing will be integrated to automatically determine and assign categories to each expense, making financial tracking effortless and accurate.

- **Modern, User-Friendly Dashboard:**  
  A responsive dashboard built with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will provide users with real-time analytics, interactive charts, and comprehensive reports to monitor their spending patterns.

- **Personalized Financial Insights:**  
  Future enhancements will include support for individual user profiles, budgets, and financial goal tracking, enabling users to receive tailored insights and recommendations.

- **Seamless Financial Data Integration:**  
  Planned integration with popular banks and financial institutions will allow the automatic import and reconciliation of transactions, streamlining the expense tracking process further.
